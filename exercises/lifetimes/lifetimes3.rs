// Lifetimes are also needed when structs hold references.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint lifetimes3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.

// * We added the liftime annotatino to the struct declarations and its fields
// * This is necessary here because at least one of the fields is a reference
