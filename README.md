# ðŸ¦€ Commented solutions for Rustlings 5.6.1

This repository contains **commented** solutions for the [Ruslings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) exercises, adding brief notes on what was necessary to complete the challenges.

Whenever relevant, I also added different ways that the code could be written (in many cases in a more idiomatic way).

### References

I used this excellent repository as a learning reference, and to compare my solutions to already existing ones:

The rusting exercises, particulary the hints, offer many direct references to the documentation.
